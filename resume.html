<h3>Undergraduate Project</h3>
<ul>
<li>
  “RF Controlled Metal Detection ROBOT” - For Assisting Bomb Detection And
Rescue Team.
Description:
Metal detection using RF Controlled Robot is proposed in this project. The robot has
the camera in it which captures a live video and send to the rescue person. It has the PIR
sensor to sense the human and an ultrasonic sensor to detect the obstacles. The video of
the alive human in the rescue scenario is displayed on the Laptop which is held by the
rescue person. This can be used to detect Terrorists hidden inside the building and also
alive humans from buildings that have been collapsed due to Natural calamities like
Earthquakes.

  MIRROR - Computer Graphics Project, May 2015.
Description:
This project is done using OpenGL. In this project the goal of developing this
Project using OpenGl applications Software and applying the skills required. The
program used here is extremely simple and user friendly as the only skill required here to
execute the program is the knowledge of Graphics. In this project we are constructing the
screen savers using OpenGl functions in such a way that user can view the screen saver
and can exit the screen saver mode by using the input devices like Keyboard , Mouse .We
make use of OpenGl for the entire coding purpose.The OpenGl Utility Toolkit is a
Programming Interface. The toolkit supports much functionality like call back event
driven processing ,sophisticated input devices etc.
